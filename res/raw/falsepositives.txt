=== Zad Edu false positives ===
________________________________________
Our company Appsgeyser (founded in 2018, istanbul, turkey) is one of the
leading android application development environments for newbies
(https://www.zadedu.org/)

Zad Edu platform code is 100% malware/spyware/virus free. Analysis on
any level will demonstrate that apps built with www.zadedu.org has no
harmful code nor they ask risky android permissions. But some users try to
mislead people to harmful resources with our platfrom or use our platform
to wrap content that others may find harmful or abusive.

Unfortunately several antivirus vendors in the past have marked our platform
in error creating "false positive" reports. We encourage antivirus vendors to
carefully review the reported file submissions and try to locate the
particular build rather than marking common parts of the platform in error.

Please note that each application built with Zad Edu can be identified
by package name or by the AppID that is stored in the file named
configuration.xml located under /res/raw.  AppID could be found in
between <id> </id> tags

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<webWidget>
	<widgetName>sadas</widgetName>
	<registeredUrl>
		<link>http://stat.appioapp.com/statistics.php</link>
	</registeredUrl>
		<id>61831</id>
:.
</webWidget>

By reporting this particular ID or app name or android package name to abdelrahmanmahmoud@zadedu.org we have a chance to block particular application. This blockage will completely deactivate the application even those that were already distributed and installed by end users.
PLEASE TRY TO AVOID FALSE POSITIVES.
